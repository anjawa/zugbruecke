Installation
============

Getting *Wine*
--------------

For using *zugbruecke*, you need to install **Wine** first. Depending on your platform,
there are different ways of doing that.

* `Installation instructions for various Linux distributions`_
* `Installation instructions for Mac OS X`_
* `Installation instructions for FreeBSD`_

.. _Installation instructions for various Linux distributions: https://www.winehq.org/download
.. _Installation instructions for Mac OS X: https://wiki.winehq.org/MacOS
.. _Installation instructions for FreeBSD: https://wiki.winehq.org/FreeBSD

Currently, Wine >= 4.x is supported (tested). If you are limited to an older version of Wine such as 2.x or 3.x, you have two options: Try `an older version of this package`_ or try to set the ``pythonversion`` configuration parameter to ``3.5.4``.

.. _an older version of this package: https://github.com/pleiszenburg/zugbruecke/releases/tag/v0.0.14

Getting *zugbruecke*
--------------------

The latest (more or less) **stable release version** can be installed with *pip*:

.. code:: bash

	pip install zugbruecke

If you are interested in testing the latest work from the **development branch**, you can try it like this:

.. code:: bash

	pip install git+https://github.com/pleiszenburg/zugbruecke.git@develop

After installing the package with ``pip``, you may choose to manually initialize the "Wine Python environment" by running ``wenv init``. If you choose not to do this, ``zugbruecke`` will take care of it during its first use.

If you are relying on *zugbruecke*, please notice that it uses semantic versioning. Breaking changes are indicated by increasing the second version number, the minor version. Going for example from 0.0.x to 0.1.0 or going from 0.1.y to 0.2.0 therefore indicates a breaking change. For as long as *zugbruecke* has development status "alpha", please expect more breaking changes to come.

Possible problem: ``SSL/TSL has issues - please install "certifi" and try again``
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While running ``wenv init``, the command may terminate with a ``SystemExit`` exception entitled ``SSL/TSL has issues - please install "certifi" and try again``. This may happen on systems with older versions of ``libssl`` (``libopenssl``) or configuration issues regarding the SSL certificate store. You will most likely see additional information telling you that an SSL certificate could not be validated.

In most cases, a **clean solution** is to install ``certifi`` with pip: ``pip install -U certifi``. The ``-U`` option forces ``pip`` to update ``certifi`` if it is already installed. Once you have installed or updated ``certifi``, you can run ``wenv init`` again.

On known problematic systems, you may also choose to install ``zugbruecke`` directly with ``certifi`` included: ``pip install zugbruecke[certifi]``. Notice that this may have undesired security implications.

Possible problem: ``OSError: [WinError 6] Invalid handle``
----------------------------------------------------------

On older versions of Linux such as *Ubuntu 14.04* alias *Trusty Tahr* (released 2014), you may observe errors when running ``wenv python``. Most commonly, they will present themselves as ``OSError: [WinError 6] Invalid handle: 'z:\\...`` triggered by calling ``os.listdir`` in ``pip`` or ``importlib`` on folders related to ``zugbruecke``. You can easily test whether you are affected by this issue or not by running ``wenv python -c "import zugbruecke; print(dir(zugbruecke))"``. If you see the described ``OSError`` instead of meaningful output, you are affected.

A **clean solution** is to upgrade to a younger version of Linux. E.g. *Ubuntu 16.04* alias *Xenial Xerus* (released 2016) is known to work.

If upgrading Linux is not an option, there is a **less clean workaround**. Before running ``wenv init``, you can set the configuration option ``_issues_50_workaround`` to ``True``, see chapter on :ref:`configuration <configuration>`. If you have already initialized your *Wine Python environment* with ``wenv init``, you must remove it with ``wenv clean`` and then re-initialize it with ``wenv init``. Notice that - if you are using this workaround - removing your *Wine Python environment* with ``wenv clean`` and re-initializing it with ``wenv init`` is necessary after every update of ``zugbruecke``.
